# Disease Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The workflow is organized step by step, starting from dataset setup to model evaluation.

---

## üìÇ Project Workflow

### 1. Dataset Setup
- Imported dataset from Kaggle (`heart-disease-data`).
- Used Google Colab to handle file upload and Kaggle API authentication.
- Loaded dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

### 2. Data Exploration
- Previewed the dataset using `.head()`.
- Checked column names and dataset structure.
- Verified missing values with `.isnull().sum()`.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in numeric columns using **mean imputation**.
- Ensured dataset consistency for further processing.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization.
- Plotted distributions and relationships between features.
- Analyzed patterns to understand which features may influence heart disease.

### 5. Feature Importance
- Identified important features contributing to prediction.
- This step helps reduce noise and improves model efficiency.

### 6. Model Building
- Applied machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc. ‚Äì depending on notebook code).
- Trained models using cleaned and processed dataset.

### 7. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
- Compared models to identify the best-performing one.
